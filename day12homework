“prompt”: “A terrifying and dramatic movie poster for a horror film inspired by Ghost Face. The poster features a dark, eerie background with a foggy, moonlit forest. In the foreground, a menacing figure resembling Ghost Face stands ominously, holding a gleaming knife. The face is shrouded in a haunting white mask, with dark hollow eyes and a twisted, open mouth as if screaming. Blood splatters and claw marks are subtly incorporated into the design. The title of the movie, ‘Screaming Shadows,’ is written in bold, jagged red font at the bottom. A tagline above reads, ‘Fear has a new face.’ The overall tone is chilling and suspenseful, evoking pure terror.”,
